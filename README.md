# Time-Series-Prediction
Time Series Prediction on a Road Data Set Collected using Sensors

# Objective
To perform predictions of 10th year Parameter 9-13 from the given dataset for every Section by using previous 9 years

# Method
Tested different models to acheive the best Possible RMSE

RMSE for XGBoost: 25.61

RMSE for ExtraTreesRegressor: 41.81

XGBoost had the lowest RMSE, hence it was used to predict the data for the 10th year for each section. Graphs were also plotted for comparison.
